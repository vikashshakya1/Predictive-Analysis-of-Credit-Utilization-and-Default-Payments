# Predictive-Analysis-of-Credit-Utilization-and-Default-Payments
This presents an analysis of a dataset titled "Default of Credit Card Clients" using machine learning techniques. Thus, in this research, an endeavour is made to analyse and find the systematic credit consumption behaviour and default payment probability of the credit card clients. According to the 30,000 customers records data set, it established critical drivers of credit card balance to the credit limit ratio, repayment behaviour, and demographic factors to default. Additionally, preprocessing entailed, dealing with missing values, treatment of outliers and creation of new features like Credit Utilization Rate along with SMOTE to address the class imbalance. This was complimented by customers aged 20-29 years, or those with a credit utilization rate of more than 50 percent and who are classified as having high default risks. Three models of machine learning with the capabilities of making accurate forecast of the defaults were applied and these included; Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest where the later emerged as the most competent in its performance and accuracy with an accuracy level of 81% while AUC=.88. There are specific implications from these results for financial institutions: First, default risks associated with high levels of utilization must be controlled Second, better repayment options should be promoted Third, high-risk users should be targeted differently. Future studies will also include the extension of the list of financial indicators that contribute to credit risk measurement in real-time.
